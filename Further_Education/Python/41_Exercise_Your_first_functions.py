Functions
- Create a program that defines functions for the four mathematical basic
  operations(+, -, *, /)
  - One function for one operation, e.g. sum_up for addition
  - Each function should take two parameters/arguments and return
    the result of the calculation
- Call each of the functions at least three times with different parameters
  - That means you need 12 different statements tat look like this:
    result1 = sum_up(12,8) for example
  - You can choose whatever numbers you want to hand over you functions as
    arguments.
