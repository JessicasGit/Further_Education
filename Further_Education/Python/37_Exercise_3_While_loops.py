3 While Loops
Created by: Jessica GÃ¶ckler
- Write a program that uses while loops to finish the tasks below,
  unknown length means that you define the length by yourself,
  e.g. with range or by simply creating a list on your own,
  but don't print it out:
  - searching for a specific number (e.g. 5) in an integer list of
    unknown length
  - Multiplying all elements with each other of an integer list of unknown
    length (7 elements at least and 15 at maximum)
  - Printing out the contents of a string list of unknown length elementwise

# fist part
while input1 != 5 in list1:
    print("We try to reach number 5!")
    input1 = int(input("Try again: "))
print("We found",input1,"in the list.")
# second part

while i < len(list1):
