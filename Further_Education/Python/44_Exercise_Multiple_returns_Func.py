Functions multiple returns
- In exercise 41 you created four differnt functions, now combine them into
  a new function that returns all four results at once
  - return result1,result2,result3,result4
- Call this function at least three times with different parameters and print
  out the results
  - You need three lines that look like this:
    result1,result2,result3,result4 = math_operations(20,5)
  - Choose the numbers you hand over as arguments freely
- Call the function at least once by specifying only 1 variable
  name -> results = math_operations(20,5)
