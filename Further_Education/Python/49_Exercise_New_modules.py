New modules
- Write a program that asks the user so guess a specific number
- Generate a random number between 0 and 99, search the library to find
  a module and a function for this task
- Generate a while loop that asks for a guess as long as the user didn't guess
  right
   - This is where you have to define your input
- Print out hints if the user is lower or higher than the random number by
  using an if/elif/else statement
- Count the number of guesses the user needed and print them out after the user
  guessed correctly
