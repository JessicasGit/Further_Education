Functions with loops
- Write a program that contains two different functions which both take a list
  as argument
- The first function returns the sum of all elements in the list,
  calculated by a loop
  - You can use the loop you defined on your previous exercises and put it into
    your function via copy and paste, but don't forget to adjust the intendation
- The second function searches for the biggest element inside the handed over
  list by using a loop containing an if statement, similar to an
  earlier exercise.
