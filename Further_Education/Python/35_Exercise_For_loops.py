For Loops
Created by: Jessica GÃ¶ckler
- All following loops should run at least over a range from 0 to 21
- Write one loop that sums up all numbers in the set range
- Write another loop that sums up only the even numbers in the set range
- Write a third loop that generates a list that contains the values
  of the range in reverse order
- Print out all three results
