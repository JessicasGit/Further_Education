Pseudocode
- Write a Pseudocode for the programs you created for the
  exercises 35, 37 and 38
- Exercise 35 – for your for loop that calculates the sum
- Exercise 37 – for your while loop that searches for a
  specific number
- Exercise 38 – for your loops that find the biggest number of
  a matrix
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 35
Write one loop that sums up all numbers in the set range

sum = x
for i in list(range):
    sum += i
print(Finish)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 37
Write a program that uses while loops to finish the tasks below,
  unknown length means that you define the length by yourself,
  e.g. with range or by simply creating a list on your own,
  but don't print it out:
searching for a specific number (e.g. 5) in an integer list of
    unknown length

Define a list
Define an input
while input != x in list:
    print(User haven’t typed in x)
    input = class(input("User should repeat until x is typed in"))
print("Finish")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 38
Search for the biggest number of the matrix, by including an if-clause
inside your loops and saving the corresponding value in a variable you
overwrite everytime your of becomes True

Loop to find the biggest number of a matrix
matrix = Definition
Definition of max number
for i in matrix:
    for j in matrix[i]:
        if max < matrix[i][j]:
            maxi = matrix[i][j]
print(Finish)
