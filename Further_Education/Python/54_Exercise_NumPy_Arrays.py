NumPy Arrays
- Write a simple python program that generates the following arrays:
  - An array consisting of 25 zeros
  - An array consisting of 8 ones
  - An array consisting of numbers from 0 to 24 in order
  - An array consisting of 9 entries of your choice
  - An two-dimensional array TD consisting of 6 rows of arrays with 5 entries each
  - A transposed version of the two-dimensional array TD
- Write furthermore an algorithm to print out the sum, maximum value,
  minimum value and shape of all created Arrays
