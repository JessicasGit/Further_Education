Loop through a matrix
Created by: Jessica GÃ¶ckler
- Write a program that uses nested loops to tackle the tasks below:
  - Search for the biggest number of the matrix, by including an if-clause
    inside your loops and saving the corresponding value in a variable you
    overwrite everytime your of becomes True
  - Sum up all numbers in the matrix so that you have one number at the end
  - Describe the multiplication of the components of two matrices in a third
    resulting matrix, which contains only zeros at the start of your loops
  - The outer loop always runs through the outer list (sublist by sublist)
    an the inner loop runs through the elements of the sublists.
