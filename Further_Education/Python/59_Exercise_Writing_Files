Writing files
- Write a program that creates two different files
- The fist file should be opened normally, that means just use open() and no
  "with" and two lines should be written in it by using file.write()
- Afterwards close the file, open it again and add another three lines of the
  text to the file
- The second file should be generated by using "with" and a loop to write a
  countdown from 10 to 0
- Each number should be in a separate line, so you need to add "\n" to your
  file.write command
