Reading a file
- Read on your second file from exercise 59, the one with the countdown,
  by using the generator method
  - You need to write a loop after your with statement to be able to read in
    line by line
- Calculate the sum of the numbers and print out the result
  - Don't forget that everything we read in is a string so you need to cast
    the lines to int() before you can sum them up
"""
