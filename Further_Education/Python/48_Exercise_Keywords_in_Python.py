Keywords in Python
- Create a list with at least 15 entries you choose
- Iterate over it with a for loop and add up the elements
- Create one if statement in your loop that can't be true and add pass
- Include a second if statement in your loop that breaks the loop if your sum
  gets bigger than a threshold (you choose)
- Include a third if statement in your loop that uses continue if the current
  entry of your list is in a specific range, e.g. 50 to 60, and prints out
  something in all other cases (use else)
- Print out the sum at the end.
